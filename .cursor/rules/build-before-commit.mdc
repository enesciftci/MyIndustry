# Build Before Commit Rule

## Critical Rule
**NEVER commit without building first!**

Before any git commit or git push operation, you MUST:

1. Run dotnet build for the entire solution
2. Verify the build completes with 0 errors
3. Only then proceed with git operations

## Build Commands

For backend (.NET):
cd /Users/enes.ciftci/Desktop/personalApps/MyIndustry
dotnet build

For frontend (React):
cd /Users/enes.ciftci/Desktop/ui/MyIndustry.UI
npm run build

## Commit Workflow

1. Make code changes
2. Run build -> dotnet build or npm run build
3. Check for errors -> Must be 0 Error(s)
4. Stage changes -> git add -A
5. Commit -> git commit -m "..."
6. Push -> git push origin main

## Important Notes

- Warnings are acceptable, errors are NOT
- If build fails, FIX the errors before committing
- This prevents broken builds in CI/CD pipelines (Dokploy)
- Always verify both backend AND frontend if changes affect both
